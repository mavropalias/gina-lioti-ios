                "description": "<p>An all handmade minced meat sauce with simple ingredients that is hard to resist. You can use it with any kind of pasta you like, but spaghetti is one of the best ways to have it. </p>\n<p>You can also try it baked in the oven, with melted cheddar cheese on top of it, or with grated parmesan. But I assure you, simple spaghetti with minced meat is just as tasty. The minced meat is so yummy, that it doesn’t really need anything else. </p>\n",
                "description2": "If you have leftover sauce, you can put in in an airtight container in the freezer and enjoy it later; you will only need to cook the pasta. ",

                "description": "<p>These biscuits are probably the first thing I ever cooked by myself, when I was about 7 years old. They are a perfect treat for the holidays, so yummy that you will make them again and again, all year round. They are traditional German jam biscuits, called spitzbuben and they are a variation of Linzer biscuits (no grounded almond in the German ones). </p>\n<p>The recipe is from a children&#8217;s recipe book by Unicef, called Little Cooks, that has &#8220;recipes from around the world for boys and girls&#8221;. It has recipes from various countries and a few useful hints and tips to help you begin cooking. They are easy, but interesting, tasty and presented in grids of drawings that are both clear and really, really enticing. It was one of the few sources available to me at that time (no internet, you see, in the dinosaur age) that I could learn about other cultures and eating habits. </p>\n<p>That book is still one of the most important reasons that I love all different peoples and I appreciate their cooking and eating habits. It is one of the reasons that I try different cuisines, whenever I have the chance and I am interested in their local specialities, not to mention that this book is one of the reasons that I want to visit every single place on earth. </p>\n<p>To get back to the biscuits, though, they were also favoured by the whole family. They were asking me to make them for years to come, whenever they visited, until they learned to make them themselves. It was always either these amazingly tasty biscuits or a sunken apple cake, which both are German recipes, although from different sources. </p>\n<p>You can use any type of jam you want, but I always make them with raspberry jam, mostly because I have always made them that way and they are so amazingly tasty that I would not want to ruin them by changing it. Also, The recipe calls for 1 teaspoon lemon juice and a little bit of salt, that I never use, but you can if you want to. </p>\n<p>You will also need cookie cutters and parchment paper. </p>\n",

They have a distinct sweet flavour and are cooked in many ways, from picked to stuffed with feta and many more. My favourite way to cook them is plain roasted, and I use them as an accompaniment to meat, usually. </p>\n<p>Of course, I can’t find Florina peppers here in Ireland, but bullhorn peppers work just as well. I only kept the name in the title, because of the way they are prepared. Even in Greece, if you don’t have Florina peppers, you can make the same salad with other types of peppers and you can still call them Florina peppers, even if technically they are not. </p>\n",

I always use lemons to cook the meat and a few simple spices, depending on what I have fresh or dried on my kitchen at the time. </p>\n<p>In Greece, we always cook the meats thoroughly. If you like your lamb rare, this recipe probably is not for you, but if you like it tender, it is. </p>\n<p>If you don’t have the time to slow roast it, you can make it much faster, just raise the temperature at 190-200 degrees (Celsius) and cook without lid, turning once during cooking.<br />\nYou can also ignore the steps regarding the garlic, if you don’t like it. </p>\n",

You can find variations of it in Greece and in other neighbouring countries, like Turkey, where they make amazing desserts and syrupy ones are their specialities. This is one of my favourite versions, it is quick and easy and it has the best ratio of cake to syrup, but you can make it with more syrup if you like. </p>\n<p>The normal recipe is made with semolina, while this one is made with flour. I will bake one with semolina at some point and give you the recipe for it, too. </p>\n",

Even though they are not related, they taste a little like artichokes and they almost have the texture of potatoes.</p>\n<p>I have not had the chance to experiment much with them, as they are not easy to find. The first time I bought them, I boiled them and added olive oil, lemon, salt, pepper and parsley and they were so tasty, so mouth-wateringly tasty that everytime I found them I kept cooking them this way. I also added a few to soups and they make a big, tasty difference. </p>\n<p>Try them as an accompaniment to pork chops, beef fillets or steaks, even with souvlaki or on their own, as a warm salad/snack. </p>\n",

                "description": "<p>This soup is based on a simpler version my father used to cook during the winter. I loved coming home from school on a cold day and eating a plate of this soup. It was made with diced beef, potatoes, courgettes, leaf celery &#8211; a type of celery found in Greece – olive oil, lemon and of course salt and pepper. </p>\n<p>In my version of the recipe, I added carrots, onion, rice, quinoa, chilli peppers and a few spices. Both versions are great. My father&#8217;s recipe has a lightly brown, almost clear broth and has a lighter taste and appearance, in general. This one is richer and fuller. You can try adding or removing any of the ingredients that you don&#8217;t like. If you are a vegetarian, for example, just remove the meat; if you avoid carbohydrates remove the rice and potatoes and so on. It is so rich in taste it won’t make a big difference anyway, even if you remove two or three ingredients. The same goes for spices, add or remove any of them. For example you can use ginger, freshly grated or powder or both, or a few saffron strings, or some curry powder or even more and different types of chillies. Just experiment and see what you like. </p>\n",

I grew up in a small town, at a time when we had a neighbourhood cow and the milk tasted so very differently, it’s almost as if it was something else entirely.</p>\n<p>A neighbour of mine was a lady that usually had no patience for other peoples’ kids, except for when her grandchildren visited from abroad. At those rare occasions (less than once per year), she made rice pudding for the family and as a friend of the kids I was allowed to have one. I was looking forward to their visit, so I could have a bowl of rizogalo.</p>\n<p>It was the best pudding I had ever had and have never tasted anything similar since then. It is entirely possible that she did not use any sugar at all, as the cow’s milk was so tasty by itself that the sugar would ruin its naturally sweet taste.</p>\n<p>The whole neighbourhood smelled wonderfully of milk and cinnamon.</p>\n<p>I have tried a few times to make it as she did, but I am missing the most important ingredient: the milk. Thus, I have to use sugar, but it just is not quite right. Still, of all the recipes I have researched and tried, this is the one closest to the original. If possible, make it with Jersey or Guernsey milk.</p>\n",

But as with everything else, you can’t compare them to the handmade ones.</p>\n<p>This is the best recipe for easy and tasty pittas. Prepared in only a few minutes and fried in a few more, with only 5 ingredients in total, they are so much better than anything you have ever tasted in a gyros shop. You can even have them instead of bread, to dip in soups. But of course they are best served with souvlaki or gyros, tzatziki (or any other dip) and a simple tomato and cucumber salad.</p>\n",

It goes especially well with meats, but also with other meze. You can line your pitta breads or fajitas when making gyros or souvlaki sandwiches, topping with the meat, vegetables and/or potatoes. You can make it as spicy as you can handle, using any kind of chillies you prefer, red or green or both, from Jalapeños to habanero and naga. You can also put your chillies in the oven for 15 minutes, place them in a closed bag to make them sweat and after a few minutes peel them. This makes them more tender, but the crunchiness of the raw chillies is nice too – and you avoid the baking. This version of tirokafteri is the northern Greek one; there are many more, but I think this is the best.</p>\n",
                "description2": "Alternatively, you can place the chillies into a processor for a few seconds and then add the feta cheese and the rest of the materials, until they are all a smooth paste. It is easier and faster this way, but the final product loses its texture. Although I am not a big fan of feta, I am a huge fan of chilli peppers and I prefer the first method. It is much more interesting, as the feta and chillies are more or less crumbly at places or bigger or smaller pieces, respectively. But as with everything edible, it is a matter of preference. ",

Same with gyros, it can be eaten after a long night out drinking, the next morning, or if you prefer it as lunch, or dinner, or… you get the picture. You can marinate the meat, if you want to, but this recipe does not require it. You can also substitute pork for chicken, or even lamb, if pork is not your thing. If it is, I recommend that you use pork belly. The secret of this recipe is in the serving; you drizzle with olive oil and lemon and sprinkle with salt, pepper and oregano. This way your meat stays succulent.</p>\n",

You can combine with meat, fish or seafood, or other meze and a shot (or many more) of tsipouro, raki or retsina. In Greece, dips are also used as side dishes. They are usually placed strategically in the middle of the table, like meze or salads, so that everyone can have easy access. Dips and side dishes are shared by everyone; it is a bit unusual, but not unheard of, for people to use a spoon to get a serving at their own plate.</p>\n",

After having tried and loved it, you can experiment with the taste yourself. Try it with more, less, or no garlic, with or without cayenne pepper, mix the chilli in the paste, or remove it altogether. ",

                "description": "<p>Kourabiedes (kourabies in singular) are usually made as a Christmas treat In Greece. They resemble shortcake biscuits with almonds and lightly dusted powdered sugar. </p>\n<p>They originate from Persia, but since then they have taken many forms and many places make them differently. In Greece, the traditional ones are made with butter, although many contemporary recipes use margarine or sunflower oil, but the ones made with pure butter are far superior; they are both healthier and tastier. </p>\n<p>In some areas they are sold all year round, but during Christmas you can find them at every pastry shop &#8211; and there usually is one in almost every neighbourhood. The custom is that when you visit friends or family during the holidays, you bring them a box of kourabiedes or melomakarona (a syrupy biscuit made with semolina, cinnamon, walnuts and honey) or even better half of each. </p>\n<p>But, as usual, homemade ones are so much better. This recipe uses only a few ingredients, so the taste is unspoiled and pure. They are really yummy and once you get the hang of them, not hard to make; I definitely recommend them. </p>\n",

                "description": "<p>Gyros is a traditional and very tasty Greek food; a medicine after a long night out drinking, or at any other time of the day, really (yes, even breakfast). I have never tried to make it at home while I was living in Greece, basically because you could find it everywhere, but mostly because it wasn’t my favourite dish the way most places made it. It is easier to find decent souvlaki, but gyros needs talent to make. My partner loves his gyros, though, so after various – mostly failed &#8211; attempts to have people bring it over here from Greece by plane, I decided to make it at home. And as it happens, I never had really good gyros, until I tried to make it myself – and I had a few good ones. Better ingredients and you control the freshness and the spices that you prefer. You can make it plain, with salt, black pepper and oregano, or add any spices that interest you, like curry, turmeric, thyme, mustard powder, paprika. My favourite combination is the following, as I like it spicy.</p>\n",
                "description2": "It is really easy to make and very tasty. You can serve with bread, pitta bread, fajitas, French fries, yoghurt, tzatziki, tirokafteri, fresh sliced tomatoes, sliced onion, paprika dip or even plain gyros with baked potatoes, potato salad, grilled sweet red peppers or a Greek salad.\r\n\r\nYou can sprinkle on top of it extra oregano, chilli flakes or parsley and/or you can even serve with mayonnaise, ketchup, or mustard, although I would not recommend it, I think ready-made condiments ruin the taste. \r\n\r\nI will also try to make chicken gyros; I will share the results and photos, of course, but I expect it will be yummy.

You add all the other ingredients and mix everything in a bowl, until all the meat is covered in spices and olive oil/vinegar.

Obviously if you marinate it longer it will be better, but it is still amazing if you leave it for 5 minutes. Vinegar is important because it tenderises the meat and I would not recommend you substitute the belly for leaner meat, natural fat is half the taste of gyros. ",

Then, put the meat in a baking dish, preferable a large one, so that your gyros is evenly spread out, avoiding heaps. I suggest you use the combination of warm air/grill setting of your oven. Stir, mix and shuffle the gyros while it is baking, so that it will all cook throughout and the pieces on top will get a little crunchy. If you see that your meat has released water on your baking dish, empty it from a corner, as you don't want it to boil. You might have to do this more than one time during cooking. ",

                "description": "<p>Bouyourdi is a delicious savoury dish, usually served with meat dishes or other meze. As with other delicacies, different places make it differently. My favourite is the Northern Greek version of it, which uses only a few, simple ingredients. Other areas make it with Kaseri (a Greek semi-hard, yellow cheese), onions, sweet peppers, even olives. When we were having barbeques, we used to prepare it in tin foil, making a little boat and putting all the ingredients inside, closing it at the top until everything melted. The oven works just as well, though, especially if you use the grill setting. You can use it as a side dish, meze or dip.</p>\n",
                "description2": "You can dip bread in it, or you can have it as a side. It is amazing with pork chops, beef steaks or fillets, lamb chops, fried chicken fillets or on its own as a snack. ",

                "description": "<p>Tzatziki is a classic dish, used as a meze, appetizer or dip. It is a perfect accompaniment of meats; it can be used in sandwiches, in pittas or with bread sticks, bread, carrot or celery sticks, as a dip. Organic yoghurt and cucumber are of course far superior and the taste will be better and fuller with full fat yoghurt. You can use half a cucumber or a whole; I prefer it will less yoghurt and more cucumber and I also prefer to keep the skin of the cucumber, as it makes the tzatziki both crunchier and better looking. But you can peel it off, if you want. It is also much, much better with garlic, but if you have low blood pressure, you can remove it. It is also a good idea to remove the garlic if you plan on being in close proximity to other humans, as your breath will not be very pleasant, to say the least. But if everyone has some, you&#8217;ll all be happier.</p>\n",

They are not very healthy, though, because they are mostly made of flour and because of the sunflower oil, but if you only have them once in a while, it’s fine. It’s a little difficult to resist making them more often, but it helps that they need a while to prepare. They are great for breakfast or for a snack during the day.</p>\n",

                "description": "<p>Bougatsa can be sweet or savoury; it is a common Greek breakfast snack, usually found in shops that specialize in breakfast foods that you can take away.<br />\nOther goodies you can enjoy there are tiropita (feta pie), spanakopita (spinach, or spinach-and-feta, pie), loukanikopita (sausage pie), calzone, peinirli, pizza slices and other variations of these.</p>\n<p>But cream bougatsa is the sweet version of it. You haven&#8217;t tried good bougatsa, unless you have made your own. The shops’ one is edible, for when you are on the go, but the homemade one is so much, much better, to the point that it’s almost not fair to compare them.</p>\n<p>It might seem complicated to make, but it really is not that hard. If you practice it a couple times it will seem like the easiest and tastiest dessert or breakfast food. You can also serve it as a party food, with toothpicks on each bite-size piece.</p>\n",
                "description2": "The end product is about 8 servings, but it depends on how you cut it. We are two people and this is way too much for us, especially since you can't expect it to be any good after more than a couple of days. But the good news is that you can put individual servings in the freezer. Just warm in the oven or microwave and sprinkle with powdered sugar and cinnamon. It will still be much better than having bought it from a shop and you can take it with you at work, have it as breakfast or a treat when you really crave something sweet.",

                "description": "<p>Spanakorizo is an easy, light and healthy dish that can be eaten as a main or as a side, any time of the year. In Greece it is mostly used as a main dish and it is served with feta cheese. Its main ingredients are spinach and rice.</p>\n<p>As with most dishes, different places make it differently. The most usual versions are with chopped tomatoes or lemon juice. As an avid lover of lemons, the latter version is the one I prefer. The end result is also much lighter than if it would be if you were to make it with tomatoes.</p>\n<p>You can also tweak the spinach and rice ratio to your preferences. I prefer more spinach and less rice; I think the taste and texture are better this way. Plus rice is not the best food, so the less, the better. But try it yourself and see what you like better.</p>\n<p>The traditional recipe for spanakorizo calls for sautéing the onions in olive oil, then adding the spinach and finally the rice and boiling them all together, but I think this is the wrong way to do it for several reasons. Firstly, you ruin your onions and it loses most of its health benefits when it is heated in high temperatures. Secondly, olive oil is much, much better tasting and healthier raw. Lastly, boiling spinach for 25 minutes makes it taste like grass, not to mention you lose each and every one of its health benefits. You might as well eat straw.</p>\n<p>Plus, spinach&#8217;s oxalic acid gives you the sensation of having eaten chalk, but with my recipe the problem is minimized; you will hardly sense it. And most importantly, adding lots of freshly squeezed lemon juice (vitamin C) on top of your plate (again, not boiling away all of it) helps your body absorb the spinach’s iron that oxalic acid blocks.</p>\n<p>The end result is a clear, clean and fresh taste, quite different than the original, but much better and healthier.</p>\n",
                "description2": "You can serve it with freshly grated parmesan or crumbled feta cheese on top. Furthermore, although I don't recommend it, you can also place it in the oven for a few minutes (set to grill), to make it golden and crunchy, with or without the cheeses. ",
